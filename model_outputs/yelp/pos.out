its pretty much like an actual irish pub , which is nice too .
the birthday surprise has been a great experience as well as her special day.
included in this price was a credit card for a great deal and an after midnight fee.
the best part of the item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !

the food is just that authentic .
actually , just keep it up !
cajun food , it is the best !
the place has improved over the years .
thank you so much these days !
i 've always feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this is the best panda express location there is !
the door would n't open at all !
my services were very good and she did a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is also very nice .
we then placed our order with our extremely happy and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just post pictures to prove their quality of work.
it is well worth over $ ( compare to what they serve !
this is a great college !
my jack and coke was amazing !
it 's refreshingly , i will definitely be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel is like chicken nuggets , and it was delicious.
i looked around and there were very nice customers .
i thought it was a great place to even serve this to diners.
we both liked it overcooked -- and the seasonings were perfect .
in turn my legs are so tender and juicy from the noodles and all over the floor.
best if at all possible .
i do n't like to be screwed over , or short changed !
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was very happy .
it 's just a great value for what you get.

pathetic place , great food !
needless to say , i will definitely be returning to this place ever again .
honestly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , in writing !
this is a nice far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
but most importantly the nicest woman was the one checking us out.
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are clean and well kept up .
